# guitarEffectsPedal
A little school project for embedded systems's course.

This isn't a serious git repo. Is more a security measure for this work. But, if the final product works, I will be very happy to see others using this code. - Diogo

This projetc uses an arduino due programmed with arduino sdk with freeRTOS libs for multi thread.

Last update: Thi is my last work on this little project. The project was presented and the school class finished. The program works well, nut has some troubles. The biggest problem is the noise.

THe selected effects was echo with a maximum of 4 echos and overdrive.

Maybe one day I can take this project again to do something more cool. Or maybe you can take this and change as you wish.
